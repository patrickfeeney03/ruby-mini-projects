This program uses Caesar Encryption to encrypt any string. The character shift can either be to the left or right. The shift amount can be specified manually.
The encryption algorithm will keep upper case letters as uppercase. The same applies for lower case characters. Any other charater that is not a vowel or consonant will remain the same, as it can be seen on the image below.
