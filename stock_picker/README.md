This program will pick the best day to buy and sell a stock depending on the price. The information is passed as an array. Each element represents the price of each day. Index 0 would be day 1 with a cost of 17 and so on.

On this case the best day to buy is at index 1 and the best day to sell is day 4 so the program returns an array [1, 4]. It is important to point out that the sell day needs to be after the buy date.
